**Building and innovating with GenC\!  Join the GenC developer community\!**

GenC offers the unique capabilities and flexibility to enable developers to experiment with GenAI applications development.  We encourage you to learn and experiment with GenC, by reviewing GenC documentation and [demos and tutorials](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/README.md).

* If you are a mobile developer who has been considering building GenAI apps, please experiment with GenC, and build new apps that deploy on mobile devices using edge LLMs, while also taking advantage of the cloud based LLM features. Please refer to GenC tutorials, especially this [Android support tutorial](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/tutorial_8_android.ipynb) for mobile applications to learn more.

* If you are a cloud application developer, you now have the opportunity to expand your apps onto mobile devices, as well as developing cloud based apps to share data and work with mobile apps that use LLMs, using Google Cloud TEE features for security and privacy. Please refer to the [Confidential Computing tutorial](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/tutorial_6_confidential_computing.ipynb) and [Private GenAI tutorial](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/tutorial_9_private_genai.ipynb) for more details.

* If you are a LangChain developer building cloud based genAI applications, please experiment with GenC to bring your apps to mobile platforms to further expand your user base. You can write code in LangChain in Python, translate it into a portable form, and deploy it to run in a Java app on a mobile device. Please refer to this [Simple Chain tutorial](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/tutorial_1_simple_cascade.ipynb), and [LangChain agent tutorial](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/tutorial_5_langchain_agent.ipynb) for more LangChain details. There's also an extensibility API that could be valuable to you, and please refer to the the [API documentation](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/api.md) for more details.

* If you’re a backend developer, please help us incorporate your service as a part of the platform via OSS contributions, and make them available as building blocks to the GenC user community and broader audience.

* If you’re an SDK developer, and are interested in contributing to the GenC ecosystem, please contact us, and let’s work together to provide flexible deployment options for your SDK users.

* If you’re an app developer that has never tried genAI development, now is the time to experiment, and please go over our [tutorials](https://github.com/google/genc/blob/master/genc/docs/tutorials/README.md) and documentation, and try to build new applications and solutions you are passionate about, and let us know what other building blocks, features, and ways of combining them that can make your work more efficient.
